## Strategy Explanation

The indicator combines two key technical indicators: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a Moving Average (MA), to identify potential buy and sell signals. Traders can customize the parameters of the RSI and MA to suit their trading preferences and risk tolerance.

For buy signals, the indicator triggers when the RSI falls below a specified buy level and the RSI difference with the previous candle is negative. This condition suggests potential oversold conditions in the market, signaling a buying opportunity.

Conversely, sell signals are generated when the RSI rises above a predetermined sell level and the closing price crosses above the moving average. This condition indicates potential overbought conditions in the market, signaling a selling opportunity.

Both buy and sell signals are visually represented on the chart with distinctive shapes, making it easy for traders to identify trading opportunities at a glance. Additionally, the indicator includes alert conditions, allowing traders to receive notifications when buy or sell signals are generated, facilitating timely decision-making.

該指標結合了兩個關鍵技術指標：相對強弱指數（RSI）和移動平均線（MA），以識別潛在的買入和賣出信號。交易者可以自定義RSI和MA的參數，以適應其交易偏好和風險承受能力。

對於買入信號，當RSI低於指定的買入水平且與前一根蠟燭的RSI差為負時，指標觸發。此條件表明市場可能處於超賣狀態，信號了一個買入機會。

相反，當RSI上升到預定的賣出水平且收盤價突破移動平均線時，生成賣出信號。此條件表明市場可能處於超買狀態，信號了一個賣出機會。

買入和賣出信號都以獨特的形狀在圖表上視覺化表示，使交易者能夠一目了然地識別交易機會。此外，該指標包括警報條件，允許交易者在生成買入或賣出信號時收到通知，從而促進及時做出決策。
